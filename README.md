New on-line polytope vertex search algorithm optimised for force and velocity polytope evaluation of serial robots.

This repository consists of 
- Matlab/octave implementation
    - full modular algorithm implementation
    - benchmarking comparison of three vertex search algorithms for *FRANKA Emika Panda* and *UR5* robot
- Python module for calculating robot capacity
    - force polytope
    - force/velocity manipulability ellipsoid
    - quick demo jupyter script
- ROS node for *FRANKA Emika Panda* robot
